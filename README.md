# To-Do List Web Application

This repository contains a simple to-do list web application developed for **Assignment 0** as part of the degree entry requirements for City College Plymouth, in conjunction with the University of Plymouth.

## üìú Project Overview

This project was created to fulfill the requirements of **Task B** of the assignment, which focuses on applying programming and scripting languages to build a functional web-based application. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly to-do list that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks.

This application demonstrates proficiency in the following areas:

  - **LO2:** Applying a variety of programming and scripting languages to produce a simple web-based application.
  - Structuring web content with **HTML**.
  - Styling with **CSS** for a clean and responsive interface.
  - Implementing client-side interactivity using **JavaScript**.
  - Managing data with a **server-side scripting language** and a database.

## üíª Technologies Used

The application is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to create a seamless user experience.

  - **HTML**: Structures the web pages, including the main to-do list view, task input forms, and action buttons.
  - **CSS**: Styles the application to ensure a visually appealing and intuitive layout.
  - **JavaScript**: Handles all client-side interactions, such as capturing user input, dynamically updating the task list without page reloads, and sending requests to the server.
  - **Server-Side Scripting (e.g., Python, PHP, Node.js)**: Manages the back-end logic, including processing incoming requests, interacting with the database to store and retrieve tasks, and ensuring data persistence.

## ‚ú® Core Features

The to-do list application is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind.

  - **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks to their list through a simple input form.
  - **Edit Tasks**: Existing tasks can be edited to reflect any changes or updates.
  - **Delete Tasks**: Completed or unwanted tasks can be removed from the list.
  - **Data Persistence**: All tasks are stored in a database, ensuring that the to-do list is saved even after the browser is closed.

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/regulating/Assignment-0-todo-app.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Assignment-0-todo-app
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies and start the server** (you will need to add specific instructions here based on the server-side language you used, e.g., `npm install` and `node index.js` for Node.js).
4.  **Open your web browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate port for your setup).
